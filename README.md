Designing and developing Quantech's website involves combining various technologies and design principles to create an engaging, responsive, and functional web presence. Here's a short description of the process using React, EmailJS, and CSS:

React:
Utilizing React for Quantech's website ensures a dynamic and efficient user interface. React's component-based architecture allows for modular development, making it easier to manage and update different sections of the website. React also enables seamless integration with other libraries and frameworks, enhancing overall performance.

EmailJS:
Integrating EmailJS into the website enables streamlined communication and enhances the user experience. By implementing EmailJS, you can easily set up a system for users to contact Quantech directly through the website. This ensures a quick and reliable method for users to reach out, enhancing communication and engagement.

CSS:
Employing CSS is crucial for achieving a visually appealing and user-friendly design. Custom styles and layouts can be applied to create a cohesive brand identity for Quantech. Responsive design principles will be implemented to ensure the website looks and functions well across various devices, providing a consistent and enjoyable experience for users.

In summary, the use of React facilitates a robust and modular website structure, EmailJS streamlines communication channels, and CSS ensures an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design. Combining these technologies results in a well-designed and efficiently developed website for Quantech.

Here are some interfaces designed and developed by me;

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
